# NYPD: Final Project

All functions for analysing the data are to be found in the functions.py module
in package/package directory. The whole program analysing the data is in the analyse.py file,
also in package/package. 

Files data_merged.csv, highest_gdp.csv and worst_emitters.csv contain some
results of the analysis for all years included in the original data. (Only 
the dataframes that were too big to be shown fully in the terminal)

The output.png file contains profiling results.
